"""
Base class for CIME system tests that involve doing two runs and comparing their
output.

In the __init__ method for your test, you MUST call
    SystemTestsCompareTwo.__init__
See the documentation of that method for details.

Classes that inherit from this are REQUIRED to implement the following methods:

(1) _case_one_setup
    This method will be called to set up case 1, the "base" case

(2) _case_two_setup
    This method will be called to set up case 2, the "test" case

In addition, they MAY require the following methods:

(1) _common_setup
    This method will be called to set up both cases. It should contain any setup
    that's needed in both cases. This is called before _case_one_setup or
    _case_two_setup.

(2) _case_one_custom_prerun_action(self):
    Use this to do arbitrary actions immediately before running case one

(3) _case_two_custom_prerun_action(self):
    Use this to do arbitrary actions immediately before running case two

(4) _case_one_custom_postrun_action(self):
    Use this to do arbitrary actions immediately after running case one

(5) _case_two_custom_postrun_action(self):
    Use this to do arbitrary actions immediately after running case two
